This python library gets geo-tagged tweet count from a specified city.

Run: python infer-load.py 23 0

This will run for 23 minutes and start counting from the beginning.

Make sure that Redis is installed from redis.io, python libraries redis, pyproj, TwitterAPI are installed.

Also be sure to make sure the redis server is running:
/etc/init.d/redis start

Software Architecture:

The software architecture consists of the following modules:

1. Google API: A module (function) for google API services that fetches bounding box in latitude/longitudes for a given address/city.

2. Lat-Long Manipulation: A module (class with several functions) for latitude-longitude manipulation. This has functionalities to convert between lat-long and UTM coordinates, create a fishnet grid (pixels) in an area based on input granularity, associate a given lat-long with a grid-pixel, convert between grid-pixel to center point in lat-long etc.

3. Twitter API: This is the most important module (few functions), that, continuosly tracks streams of tweets within a bounding box, tracks the count within each pixel in the fishnet grid, and saves the data into a persistent in-memory database called REDIS.

4. REDIS: REDIS is a very popular super-fast persistent in-memory (key, value) pair based DB that also periodically saves the data into disk. This module in the software initiates the connection to the redis server, initializes the DB if need be, and saves the data into the DB and also to an output CSV file in the end.
